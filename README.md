Omg wow, just walked out & my head’s spinning like a kaleidoscope of highlighter lights! You know that feeling when you’ve been sitting too long in a contouring session and the edges of reality smudge? BORDERLINE isn’t just a movie—it’s a freaking canvas that paints your heart & leaves watercolor splotches on your emotions. theater was packed, the popcorn ancient & stale like yesterday’s lipstick, but who cares right? The characters felt so real, like when you perfectly blend foundation & miraculously everything falls into place.

Jeez, that scene where the protagonist’s face just crumbles apart like overpriced eyeshadow when you drop it! Heartbreaking and familiar all at once. Felt the thud in my heart same way when you realize the bottle's empty mid-mascara. And then there's this moment, everything going slo-mo like when you’re the last one in Sephora before closing, trying to grab that last palette. I seriously almost dropped my phone when that plot twist hit, but managed to send a half-chewed popcorn kernel flying instead!

> wow, during one of the intense scenes, I literally felt every emotion like colors swirling together in a makeup palette—a beautifully chaotic mess. It’s like they took all the corner store concealer tragedies and wrapped them into the protagonist’s journey. I had that simultaneous urge to rewind and fast-forward, same way I feel when I overpluck a brow... y’know? Someone earlier asked if I’d download the movie—uhm yeah, definitely gonna download the movie and watch the movie again to catch what I missed while I was too busy gasping.

That soundtrack omg… like if a lip gloss could sing—it’d sound like this, smooth & layered, sticking with u long after. But okay, honest moment - my back’s aching like I’ve been hunched over perfecting winged liner for hours & the theater seats? Not exactly ergonomic...
